# 👩🏻‍💻 Finite Automata Converter

This project is a Java-based application designed for the Theory of Computation course (CSE6344). It focuses on the conversion between different types of automata and regular grammars. The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for converting regular grammars to finite automata and testing string acceptance.

### Features
1.  Convert Regular Grammar to NFA
2.  Remove ε-transitions from NFA
3.  Convert NFA to DFA
4.  Test strings for acceptance

### Technologies Used
1. Java (Programming Language Used)
2. Java Swing (GUI)

For a more detailed explanation of the program, you can refer to the project report included in the repository.

# 🔹 Installation & Usage
### Running the Application
1. Download the repository and extract the files.
2. Locate Assignment.exe inside the extracted folder.
3. Double-click Assignment.exe to launch the application.

### Input Format
- Use right-linear grammar format.
- No extra spaces in the input.
- Each production rule should be on a separate line.
- Use uppercase "E" to represent epsilon (ε).
- If a state has multiple transitions, write them in one line (e.g., A->0B|1C).
